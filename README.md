<p>Hello there mates üëã, my name is Sergiy, but I'm also known as @Ser-Martin, or simply Martin.

In the beginning, I constantly built something from Lego blocks, then scale modeling became my hobby and passion, later I chose the profession of an automated control system engineer and developed software for PLCs and HMIs, and finally, quite recently, I discovered the field of layout and frontend ...</p>

I started my journey in layout and front-end quite recently, but this area is incredibly interesting and exciting for me.

I hope that sooner or later my experience will help someone, and I—çll be able to find people who share my passion.
