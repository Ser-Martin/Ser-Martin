  Hello there mates 👋, my name is Sergiy, but I'm also known as @Ser-Martin, or simply Martin. Don't ask how I went from Sergiy to Martin, because like most people's nicknames, mine was formed in the process of communicating with various communities, etc. Therefore, feel free to contact me in any of these three options 😂

  What can I say about myself? I am a person who doesn't see his life without the possibility of creating and designing something. In the beginning, I constantly built something from Lego blocks, then scale modeling became my hobby and passion, later I chose the profession of an automated control system engineer and developed software for PLCs and HMIs, and finally, quite recently, I discovered the field of layout and frontend ...


- 👀 I’m interested in ACS engineering, HMI, UI/UX, and scalemodeling...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, js...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
